# Colored Jojo Scans Extraction
A quick program for extracting the images in the colored Jojo manga releases. Can be used to extract a series of files from within a folder containing folders.

# Installation
Download the released .exe or download the source code yourself.

# Usage
Run either `extract_vol.exe [voume's directory name here]` or drag the directory you want to extract onto the .exe file.
This will generate a new directory containing all the pages of the manga in a folder for easy reading.

# Note
If used in CMD, the program will generate the new folder in the volume's folder. If you drag it onto the .exe, it will generate the new folder where the .exe is.
